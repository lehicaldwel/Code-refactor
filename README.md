## Credits
- [Master Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) offers a variety of syntax to utilize in making this project happen.

- When using [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) I was able to mark down all the notes along with apples terminal that is also linked to my github.

- [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#content-attachments) this is where the magic happens once I was able to set up the repository everything came into play. Git hub allows the user to push and pull elements that are within the html, css, and many others. With is essentialy where I launch the live URL.
- Stuck trying to find where elements are supposed to go? [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) offers many different semantic html and this is where was I able to learn more about how to construct the html.
